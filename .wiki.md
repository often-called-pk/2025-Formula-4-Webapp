# Project Summary
The Formula 4 Race Analytics project aims to develop a web-based platform for analyzing telemetry data specifically for Formula 4 racing teams. The product will provide advanced analytics and visualization tools to enhance driver performance and optimize race strategies, thereby democratizing access to high-quality telemetry analysis.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Authentication Module**: Handles user login, registration, and session management.
- **File Upload Module**: Manages the uploading and validation of telemetry files.
- **Data Processing Module**: Processes uploaded telemetry data to extract insights.
- **Analysis Engine**: Compares driver performances and generates reports.
- **Visualization Module**: Creates interactive charts and visualizations based on processed data.
- **Database Module**: Manages storage and retrieval of telemetry data and analysis results.
